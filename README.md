Step 1: Create a GitHub account

Step 2: Create a new repository
In GitHub, a repository is a central location where files related to a project are stored, managed, and version-controlled. It facilitates collaboration among developers, tracks changes over time, and provides a platform for sharing and reviewing code.

Also you should write name your repositoy

Step 3:
Create a new file from terminal and ignore the rest for now.
Open the Terminal program on your PC.
or then again on Windows you can utilize cmd and guid it to the organizer where you stored the repo.
with directions like cd,mkdir and rm.
Type git and hit Enter. If it says command bash: git: command not found, then install Git with the command for your Linux operating system or distribution. Check the installation by typing git and hitting Enter; if it's installed, you should see a bunch of information about how you can use the command.
In the terminal, type:
mkdir Demo This command will create a directory (or folder) named Demo.
Change your terminal to the Demo directory with the command:
cd Demo Then enter:echo "#Demo" >> README.md This creates a file named README.md and writes
cat README.md This will show you what is inside the README.md file, if the file was created correctly.
To tell your computer that Demo is a directory managed by the Git program, enter:
git init Then, to tell the Git program you care about this file and want to track any changes from this point forward, enter:
git add README.md

Step 4: Make a commit
So far you've made a document and informed Git concerning it, and now it's an ideal opportunity to make a submit. Submit can be thought of as an achievement. Each time you achieve some work, you can do an git commit to store that variant of your record, so you can return later and see what it resembled by then. At whatever point you roll out an improvement to your record, you make another rendition of that document, not the same as the past one.

Step 5: Connect your GitHub repo with your computer
